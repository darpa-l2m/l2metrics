# Metrics Framework for Lifelong Learning Machines (L2M)

This repository contains foundation code for the Metrics Framework. This framework includes:

* Python libraries for processing performance logs generated by lifelong learning algorithms (both Agent and Classification Learning)
* Proposed metrics for *Continual Learning* and *Adapting to New Tasks* core capabilities
* Support for extending the framework with custom metrics

For more details, see:

* [Metrics Framework Overview](docs/metrics_documentation.pdf)
  * The above document includes a sample workflow for generating log files and processing them
* `examples/calc_metrics.py` for an example of adding a custom metric

*NOTE*: The Metrics Framework is still in development. Aspects still under development include support for distributed training and testing/validation. This repository is being released to faciliate experimentation and feedback regarding the overall approach.
