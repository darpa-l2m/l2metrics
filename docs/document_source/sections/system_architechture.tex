\textit{Overview}

The Test and Evaluation Framework (TEF) uses the information contained in a syllabus to produce a sequence of episodes for an agent learner. Figure~\ref{fig:systemlayout} depicts a high level overview of the TEF system. The syllabus passes the sequence of episodes to the TEF which sets up an environment and makes it available to the

Figure~\ref{fig:syllabus} shows an example syllabus which would evaluate the Continual Learning Core Capability. You can see that only one task is exercised throughout the syllabus, but parameter variation - agent\_pos and agent\_dir are paramters for this task - is contained throughout the syllabus. Additionally, later Test phases contain previously trained parameters, allowing for a maintenance calculation. Unless otherwise noted, an instance of a syllabus is considered a Lifetime, and metrics are computed on an Agent's performance on episodes within a syllabus.

When an Agent performs episodes from the syllabus, the TEF will automatically generate logs which are saved in a tab separated file like shown in Figure~\ref{fig:logfile}. Then, the Metrics code scrapes these logs and extracts the relevant information to produce a set of scores for each metric used to evaluate the Core Capabilty being tested.\\
